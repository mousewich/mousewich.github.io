	<h1>Exciting Chess</h1>
	<h2>What is "Exciting Chess"?</h2>
	The pithy answer is that <i>Exciting Chess</i> is chess but more exciting. The better answer is that Exciting Chess is
	an improvisation game based on the structure of chess. I drafted the first informal rules of Exciting Chess during my
	time in college studying game design. I became very interested in the study of emergent gameplay and found myself
	constantly surrounded by theater performers and comedians: a perfect pool of test subjects for my profane experiments
	(showing up to game night with a scrappy prototype and the desire to make something fun).
	<h2>The rules of Exciting Chess</h2>
	Exciting Chess is an improvisation game and the way each match plays out will vary significantly based on the players
	and any house rules in place. The core rules of play are based on the eponymous game of chess. If you are unfamiliar
	with the rules of chess, it would be wise to learn them before attempting to play Exciting Chess.
	<br><br>
	Exciting Chess has one primary rule that distinguishes it from chess: Any player may, at their own discretion, take any
	action which conflicts with the rules or draw inferences about the state of conflict at play. An example action may be
	suggesting that a Pawn flee (move backward) in the face of a substantial threat or that a King may stand its ground and
	choose to remain in check until captured. An example inference may be that the loss of both Bishops from a board has had
	an impact on the religion of the pieces in play or that a messy divorce between a player's King and Queen will have a
	negative impact on morale.
	<br><br>
	Any action or inference which is accepted by all players may be codified as a house rule for exciting chess. These
	actions become legal moves and these inferences become facts about the world of play. Actions may be influenced by
	inferences which may, in turn, require the occurrence of specific actions to become true.
	<h1>My house rules for Exciting Chess</h1>
	If you are interested in playing Exciting Chess and constructing your own library of house rules organically, you have
	already learned everything you need to know. If you wish to see the rule set I have polished over several years of board
	game nights and impromptu play sessions, read on.
	<h3>Pieces</h3>
	<h4>King</h4>
	The King is the ruling monarch of each player's board. The king must be captured like any other piece to end
	the game. The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Modified castling rules apply.
	<h4>Queen</h4>
	The Queen is a monarch. The Queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
	<h4>Castle (Rook)</h4>
	The Castle is a structure and a noble's home. The Castle moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically.
	Modified castling rules apply.
	<h4>Bishop</h4>
	The Bishop is a representative of the church. The Bishop moves any number of vacant spaces diagonally.
	<h4>Knight</h4>
	The Knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same row, column, or diagonal. The knight may jump pieces. The
	knight is a mounted unit.
	<h4>Pawn</h4>
	The Pawn is an infantry unit. As in chess, the Pawn has more movement rules than the other pieces. The Pawn moves
	straight forward one square but may only do so if that space is vacant. If the Pawn has not yet moved, the Pawn may
	instead move two square forward as long as both square are vacant. The Pawn can not move backward. The Pawn can capture
	an enemy piece in either of the two squares ahead of it diagonally but cannot move to those squares when they are
	vacant. Modified en passant and promotion rules apply.
	<h5>Promotion</h5>
	A Pawn may be promoted when it moves to an opposing player's home provided that its starting position was within a
	different player's home or barracks.
	<h3>Rules</h3>
	<h4>Check and Checkmate</h4>
	Unlike Chess, a King may choose to endanger itself and remain in Check. Any player who places an opposing King in Check
	may announce that they have done so, but the defending player may choose not to move the targeted King out of danger.
	There is no Checkmate in Exciting Chess. A king may be captured like any other piece.
	<h4>Castling</h4>
	<h4>En Passant</h4>
	<h4>Promotion</h4>
	A piece up for promotion may be replaced with any unit of a higher rank.
	<h3>Determination of Victory</h3>
	<h4>Peace</h4>
	Players may, at any time, make a deal for peace. As long as the conditions of the deal remain fulfilled, these players
	will remain at peace. If all surviving players are at peace with one-another, these players jointly win the game. A
	player may choose to redeclare war at any point, though doing so may have consequences (such as the betrayed player
	being upset).
	<h4>Elimination of the Chain of Command</h4>
	A player loses when they are no longer able to effectively issue orders of war while remaining in conflict with another
	player. The most common way to reach this end condition is the capture of a player's King when a line of royal
	succession has not been established, though there may be other ways to trigger this end.
	<h4>The Gay Agenda</h4>
	If a majority of pieces controlled by all surviving players are gay married and the religious institutions in play are
	eliminated or supportive, the gays win. All conflicts end immediately. Peace deals which are in opposition to The Gay
	Agenda end. Civil unions do not count toward a marriage majority but they are a step in the right direction.
	<h4>Points</h4>
	Points are everything and good game design demands they be complicated. Several actions in Exciting Chess will generate
	points. Each rule around points will describe which win condition these points contribute toward and how points are
	earned toward that goal.
